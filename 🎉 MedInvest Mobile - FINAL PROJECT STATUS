                                    ## 📝 FINAL NOTES

                                    This project is built with modern React Native standards and best practices. All code is production-ready and can be directly integrated into the application. The comprehensive documentation ensures that remaining phases can be implemented efficiently following the same patterns established in Phases 1-3.

                                    The architecture supports scalability, maintainability, and future feature additions. The TypeScript implementation provides type safety throughout the application.

                                    **Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT AFTER COMPLETING REMAINING PHASES**
