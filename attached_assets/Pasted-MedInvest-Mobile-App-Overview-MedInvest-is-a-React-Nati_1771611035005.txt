MedInvest Mobile App
Overview
MedInvest is a React Native/Expo mobile application that enables users to invest in medical innovations, research, and healthcare ventures. The app bridges healthcare advancement with financial opportunity, featuring a professional yet approachable design with medical blue and investment green accent colors.

The application follows a full-stack architecture with an Expo-based mobile frontend (supporting iOS, Android, and web) and an Express.js backend server. Data persistence uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.

User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

System Architecture
Frontend Architecture
Framework: React Native with Expo SDK 54, using the new architecture and React 19.

Navigation Structure:

Root stack navigator handles authentication flow (Login vs Main)
Bottom tab navigator with 4 tabs: Discover, Portfolio, Research, Profile
Each tab has its own native stack navigator for nested screens
Floating action button for primary "Invest" action opens as modal
State Management:

TanStack React Query for server state and API caching
React Context for authentication state (AuthContext)
AsyncStorage for local persistence (user data, investments, bookmarks)
UI/Styling Approach:

Custom theme system with light/dark mode support via useTheme hook
Centralized design tokens in client/constants/theme.ts (Colors, Spacing, BorderRadius, Typography)
Reanimated for animations with spring physics
Linear gradients for accent cards (medical blue to investment green)
Platform-specific adjustments for iOS, Android, and web
Key Directories:

client/screens/ - Screen components
client/navigation/ - Navigation configuration
client/components/ - Reusable UI components
client/contexts/ - React context providers
client/hooks/ - Custom hooks
client/lib/ - Utilities, API client, mock data
Backend Architecture
Framework: Express.js with TypeScript running via tsx.

API Design: RESTful endpoints prefixed with /api (routes defined in server/routes.ts).

Storage Layer: Abstract IStorage interface in server/storage.ts with in-memory implementation (MemStorage). Designed for easy swap to database-backed storage.

Database Schema: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect. Schema defined in shared/schema.ts using drizzle-zod for validation. Currently contains a users table with id, username, and password fields.

CORS Configuration: Dynamic origin allowlist based on Replit domains plus localhost for development.

Web & Mobile Sync Architecture
The packages/shared directory contains code shared between web and mobile apps:

types/ - TypeScript interfaces for User, Post, Message, Deal, etc.
validators/ - Zod schemas for form and API validation
utils/ - Common utilities (date formatting, number formatting, text parsing)
api/ - Shared API client class with platform-specific configuration
constants/ - Shared constants (limits, timeouts, error codes, storage keys)
Usage:

import { User, Post, loginSchema, formatRelativeTime } from '@medinvest/shared';
External Dependencies
Database
PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for schema definition and migrations
Database URL configured via DATABASE_URL environment variable
Migrations managed with drizzle-kit push
Authentication
Email/Password Registration: POST /api/auth/register endpoint for traditional signup
Apple Sign-In: Native iOS integration via expo-apple-authentication
Google Sign-In: OAuth 2.0 via expo-auth-session
GitHub Sign-In: OAuth 2.0 via expo-auth-session with backend token exchange
Google Sign-In Production Setup (required for production):

Go to Google Cloud Console
Create OAuth 2.0 Client IDs for each platform:
Web: Set authorized redirect URI to https://{your-production-domain}/
iOS: Set bundle ID to com.medinvest.app
Android: Set package name to com.medinvest.app and provide SHA-1 fingerprint
Expo Go: Set redirect URI to https://auth.expo.io/@{expo-username}/medinvest
Set environment variables:
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID - Web OAuth client ID
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID - iOS OAuth client ID
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID - Android OAuth client ID
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_EXPO_CLIENT_ID - Expo Go OAuth client ID
GitHub Sign-In Production Setup (requires separate apps for web and mobile):

Web OAuth App:

Go to GitHub Developer Settings
Create OAuth App for web with callback URL: https://{your-production-domain}
Set environment variables:
EXPO_PUBLIC_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID - Web GitHub client ID
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID - Same as above (for backend)
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET - Web GitHub client secret
Mobile OAuth App:

Create a second OAuth App for mobile with callback URL: medinvest://
Set environment variables:
EXPO_PUBLIC_GITHUB_MOBILE_CLIENT_ID - Mobile GitHub client ID
GITHUB_MOBILE_CLIENT_ID - Same as above (for backend)
GITHUB_MOBILE_CLIENT_SECRET - Mobile GitHub client secret
Apple Sign-In Production Setup (required for iOS):

Enable "Sign In with Apple" capability in Apple Developer Portal
Configure the app identifier with Sign In with Apple
The bundle identifier com.medinvest.app must match your Apple Developer account
Third-Party Services
Expo ecosystem: splash-screen, haptics, linear-gradient, blur, image, web-browser
React Navigation for routing (bottom-tabs, native-stack)
