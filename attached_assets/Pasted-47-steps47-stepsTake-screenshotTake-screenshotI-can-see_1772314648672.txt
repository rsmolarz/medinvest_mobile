Overall Status: ⚠️ Not yet ready — Unresolved Issues
The app has an active submission with Apple that currently shows "Unresolved Issues." Here's the history and current state:
What Happened
Apple rejected the app on Feb 18 citing three guideline violations:

Guideline 2.1 – App Completeness (Bug): After Sign In with Apple, the app was looping back to onboarding screens instead of going to the dashboard.
Guideline 2.1 – Information Needed: Apple couldn't log in with the demo credentials (demo@medinvest.com / demo) — the password was wrong/inactive.
Guideline 2.3.3 – Accurate Metadata: The 13" iPad screenshots were showing an iPhone device frame, not an iPad frame.
Joseph responded on Feb 20 with explanations, and Apple came back on Feb 24 saying the same two bugs were still present (onboarding loop + broken Terms/Privacy links on registration).


What's Been Done Since
Joseph submitted Build 4 today with a message explaining two fixes:

A race condition fix in RootNavigator.tsx for the Sign In with Apple onboarding loop
Replaced navigation.navigate() with Linking.openURL() for the Terms/Privacy links
The demo credentials have been updated to demo@medinvest.com / Demo1234!

What Still Needs to Happen
The app is in a "Ready for Review" / Unresolved Issues limbo — Build 4 has been submitted along with Joseph's message today, but it hasn't been resubmitted via the "Resubmit to App Review" button yet (or it may have just been replied to via message).
Before you can consider it truly submitted, you should verify:

Was "Resubmit to App Review" actually clicked? The page shows a blue "Resubmit to App Review" button — if that hasn't been clicked after attaching Build 4, the app hasn't formally been sent back for review.
Confirm the onboarding loop and Terms/Privacy link bugs are fixed in Build 4 before resubmitting — Apple flagged these twice, so they'll be looking closely again.
iPad screenshots — Apple originally flagged the iPad 13" screenshots as showing iPhone frames. The new screenshots look better, but worth double-checking they show the app on a proper iPad UI.
Would you like me to check whether the resubmission has been formally initiated, or help with anything else?
